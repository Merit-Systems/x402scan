# Competitive Mapping

Build detailed organizational maps of engineering, product, and leadership teams at target companies.

## Map an Engineering Organization

Understand the structure and key players in a company's engineering team.

```
Map the engineering organization at Figma. I want to understand:
- Engineering leadership (VP, Directors, Managers)
- Team structure and reporting lines where visible
- Key technical leaders and their focus areas
- Total engineering headcount estimate

Provide LinkedIn profiles for all leadership.
```

**APIs Used:** Apollo Org Search → Apollo People Search (multiple queries by seniority) → Apollo People Enrich

## Identify Recent Hires and Departures

Track talent movement at competitor companies.

```
Find people who joined Notion in the last 6 months in engineering or
product roles. Also identify any senior departures I can see from
LinkedIn data showing short tenures.
```

## Compare Team Sizes Across Competitors

Benchmark headcount and team composition across multiple companies.

```
Compare the data engineering teams at Databricks, Snowflake, and
Confluent. For each company, give me:
- Estimated team size
- Seniority distribution
- Key leaders with their backgrounds
```

## Find Acquisition Targets by Talent

that have hired engineers from Google Brain, DeepMind, or OpenAI.
List the companies and the notable hires.
