# Contact Enrichment

Transform basic contact information into complete, verified profiles ready for outreach.

---

## Enrich from Company Domain

Find the right contacts when you only know the company.

```
I want to reach out to cloudflare.com. Find me:
- The VP of Sales or CRO with their email
- The Head of Partnerships with their email
- Any relevant decision makers in business development
```

**APIs Used:** Apollo Org Search → Apollo People Search → Apollo People Enrich

---

## Bulk Enrich a Lead List

Process an existing list with missing contact information.

```
I have a CSV of 50 leads with name and company. Enrich all of them
with verified email addresses, phone numbers, and LinkedIn URLs.
Flag any that couldn't be found.
```

**APIs Used:** Apollo People Enrich Bulk → Clado Contacts Enrich (for failures)

---

## Verify Email Deliverability

Check if emails are valid before sending campaigns.

```
I have these 10 email addresses from an old list. Verify which ones
are still valid and get updated contact info for any that bounced.
```

**APIs Used:** Apollo People Enrich (checks email_status)

---

## Find Personal Contact Info

When corporate emails bounce, find alternative contact methods.

```
I can't reach john.smith@acme.com - it's bouncing. Find his personal
email or mobile number so I can reach him directly.
```

**APIs Used:** Apollo People Enrich (get LinkedIn) → Clado Contacts Enrich (email_enrichment + phone_enrichment)
