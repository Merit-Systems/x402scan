# Account Research

Gather comprehensive intelligence on target accounts to personalize outreach and identify opportunities.

## Company Deep Dive

Get a complete picture of a target account before a meeting.

Research Acme Corp thoroughly. I need:

- Leadership team and their backgrounds
- Recent news and announcements
- Tech stack and tools they use
- Any recent job postings that signal priorities
```

## Map the Buying Committee

Identify all stakeholders involved in purchasing decisions.

```
I'm selling to Acme Corp's engineering team. Map out everyone who
might be involved in a purchasing decision:
- Technical evaluators (senior engineers, architects)
- Budget holders (VP/Director level)
- Executive sponsors (CTO, CEO)

Include their LinkedIn and email for each.
```

Monitor for buying signals and conversation starters.

```
What's been happening at Datadog in the last month? Find:
- Press releases and announcements
- Executive interviews or podcasts
- Product launches
- Hiring patterns that indicate priorities

## Analyze Competitive Displacement Opportunities

Find companies that mention using Competitor X on their engineering
blog, job postings, or Stack Overflow discussions. These are
potential displacement opportunities.
