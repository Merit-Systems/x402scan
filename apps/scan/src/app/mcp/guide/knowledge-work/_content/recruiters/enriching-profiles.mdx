# Enriching Profiles

Transform basic candidate information into comprehensive profiles with contact details and work history.

---

## Enrich from LinkedIn URL

Get full professional details from a LinkedIn profile URL.

```
I have this LinkedIn profile: linkedin.com/in/example-candidate
Get their full work history, current email, phone number, and any
other contact information available.
```

**APIs Used:** Clado LinkedIn Scrape → Clado Contacts Enrich (for personal email/phone)

---

## Bulk Enrich a Candidate List

Process multiple candidates at once when you have partial information.

```
I have a list of 10 candidates with their names and current companies.
Enrich all of them with email addresses and LinkedIn profiles:
- Jane Smith, Acme Corp
- John Doe, TechStartup Inc
[...]
```

**APIs Used:** Apollo People Enrich Bulk

---

## Fill in Missing Contact Info

When Apollo data is incomplete, fall back to Clado for personal contact details.

```
I have this candidate's Apollo profile but need their personal email
and phone number for outreach. Their LinkedIn is linkedin.com/in/candidate
```

**APIs Used:** Clado Contacts Enrich (with email_enrichment and phone_enrichment flags)

---

## Verify and Update Stale Data

Re-enrich candidates whose information may be outdated.

```
This candidate's Apollo data shows they were at Company X but their
LinkedIn shows Company Y. Get me fresh data from their LinkedIn profile
and update their contact information.
```

**APIs Used:** Clado LinkedIn Scrape → Apollo People Enrich (to cross-reference)
